## Future Plans:
* 

------------------------------
# variables to take into consideration into the algorithm

* nearby biology affluence
* county economical affluence
* community investment
* population density
* safety/crime (fbi data and the type of crimes (petty to serious))
* house prices (rising, falling, stagnant (potential of growth))
* GIS data
* community activity/involvment
* neighborhood data??
* userâ€™s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments
* public transportation

Maybe: 
* "types of people" such as race, ethnicity, religion?
* geo restrictions such as restricting analysis to west coast or east coast, etc


Kit towards certain groups of individuals:
- workers: (by major, layoffs, hirings, median salary)
- parents: (education pre k to highschool, parks, safety, tree density, health care quality(readyness), etc)
- sickly: (air purity, pollution, )
- 20-30 yrs: population pyramid
- students: higher education pursuement rates


resources:
- datacommons
- data.org
- kaggle
- scraped redfin/zillow data???
- fbi, BLS, other government sources



# Design

A single page web page that allows users to select all factors possible, updating and submitting relevant information and then updating the page to do adequete analysis and output.

factors such as layoffs, major type, age, health status, etc


## output

graphs, figures, numerical analysis 
state and homes that have the most potential for growth (residential status only; no commerical)


### TODO

a way to cross reference and triangulate for data quality and quantity control. this allows us to have a greater sample size without compromising data quality or have repetition
